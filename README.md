# PasswordEncryptor

<h2> INFORMATION </h2>

This is a basic program that does the following:

1) stores username and passwords into a plaintext file

2) once logged in the user can encypt or decrypt data

3) The user can click a button to view the encrypted data

4) if the user closes the application with the data being decrypted, the data will auto decrypt on the next open,
that way the information can be read to log in

This program is just to test my basic java skills.
