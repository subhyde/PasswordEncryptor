# PasswordEncryptor

<h2> INFORMATION </h2>

This is a basic program that does the following:

1) stores username and passwords into a plaintext file

2) once logged in the user can encypt or decrypt data

3) The user can click a button to view the encrypted data

This program is just to test my basic java skills.
